## Presentation for 'What can Kotlin do for me'

The code in this repository corresponds to that used at the [Google Developer Days Krakow 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbF8Q8LxAJs). It focuses on showing some of the value of Kotlin over Java. It does not contain the examples that were done live on stage.
